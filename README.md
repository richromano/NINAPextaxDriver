# Pentax Camera Plugin

Currently tested with KP and K3-III. Should also work with K1, K1ii, 645Z.  Maybe KF and K70

When connecting always make sure that the camera is connected first and then connect the focuser.

Always disconnect the focuser first then the camera.  If you don't follow these steps then you will get errors about not connecting to the Telescope.

If your computer is sluggish after installation, you should reboot because N.I.N.A. is in a weird state.

If you want to use Bulb mode you need to connect a shutter release cable from the SNAP port on your mount to the camera. Also you need to select SNAP as the desired shutter control. Finally you need set your Auto Focus Lock setting to not use the shutter.

Note that your mount needs an ASCOM driver that supports triggering the SNAP port.  EQMOD does this.

Any issues please reach out on the Discussions board.
